## User-space

Implementing a transport protocol in user-space helped driving the development
and the quick iterations of the protocol since it was "easy" for Google to run
it in both ends of their operations and have users take advantage of new
development very frequently.

There's really nothing that prevents this protocol from being implemented and
offered by operating system kernels in a future, should someone find that a
good idea.
