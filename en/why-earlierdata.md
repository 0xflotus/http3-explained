## Earlier data

QUIC offers both a 0-RTT and 1-RTT handshakes that reduces the time it takes
to negotiate a new connection, to be compared with the 3-way handshake of TCP.

In addition to that, QUIC offers "early data" support from the get go which is
done to allow more data and it is used more easily than TCP Fast Open. (insert
horror-stories from Firefox TFO agonies?)
