# This is QUIC

This book effort was started for real in March 2018. The plan is to document
the QUIC protocol. Why, how it works, protocol details, the implementations
and more.

The book is entirely free at no cost and is meant to be a collaborative effort
involving anyone and everyone who wants to help out!

## Prerequisites

networking, the fundmentals of HTTP and the web. For further insights and
specifics about HTTP/2 we recommend first reading up the details in [http2

## Author

This book is created and the work is started by Daniel Stenberg.
