# History

The initial QUIC protocol was designed by Jim Roskind at Google and was
initially implemented in 2012, announced publicly to the world in 2013 when
Google's experimentations broadened.

Google implemented the protocol and subequently deployed it both in their
widely used browser (Chrome) and in their widely used server-side services
(Google search, gmail, youtube and more). They iterated protocol versions
fairly quickly and over time they proved the concept to work reliably for a
vast portion of users.

In June 2015, the first internet draft for QUIC was sent to the IETF for
standardization, but it it took until late 2016 for a quic working group to
get approved and started. But then it took off immediately with a high degree
of interest from many parties.
